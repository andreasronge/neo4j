    # This method is typically used in an Rails ActionController as a filter method.
    # It will guarantee that an transaction is create before your action is called,
    # and that the transaction is finished after your action is called.
    #
    # Example:
    #  class MyController < ActionController::Base
    #      around_filter Neo4j::Rails::Transaction, :only => [:edit, :delete]
    #      ...
    #  end
