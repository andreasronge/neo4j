module Neo4j

  # Contains methods for traversing relationship object of depth one from one node.
  module Rels
    include ToJava

    # Returns the only node of a given type and direction that is attached to this node, or nil.
    # This is a convenience method that is used in the commonly occuring situation where a node has exactly zero or one relationships of a given type and direction to another node.
    # Typically this invariant is maintained by the rest of the code: if at any time more than one such relationships exist, it is a fatal error that should generate an exception.

    # This method reflects that semantics and returns either:
    #  * nil if there are zero relationships of the given type and direction,
    #  * the relationship if there's exactly one, or
    #  * throws an unchecked exception in all other cases.
    #
    # This method should be used only in situations with an invariant as described above. In those situations, a "state-checking" method (e.g. #rel?) is not required,
    # because this method behaves correctly "out of the box."
    #
    # Does return the Ruby wrapper object (if it has a '_classname' property) unlike the #_node version of this method
    #
    def node(dir, type)
      n = _node(dir, type)
      n && n.wrapper
    end

    # Same as #node but instead returns an unwrapped native java node instead
    def _node(dir, type)
      r = _rel(dir, type)
      r && r._other_node(self._java_node)
    end

    # Returns an enumeration of relationship objects.
    # It always returns relationship of depth one.
    #
    # See Neo4j::Relationship
    #
    # ==== Examples
    #   # Return both incoming and outgoing relationships
    #   me.rels(:friends, :work).each {|relationship|...}
    #
    #   # Only return outgoing relationship of given type
    #   me.rels(:friends).outgoing.first.end_node # => my friend node
    #
    def rels(*type)
      Traverser.new(self, type, :both)

    # type:: the key and value to be set, default any type
